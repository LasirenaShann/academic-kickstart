# Hi

My name is Tzu-Yun, or you can call me Ariel. Currently, I work as a research assistant at [National Tsing Hua University](http://www.nthu.edu.tw/). I am very lucky to be able to collaborate with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://cymaxwelllee.wixsite.com/elsa) and his research team. My current research focuses on *reinforcement learning* and its applications in other domains (e.g, robotics, computer vision). I will be a master student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Fall 2018, advised by [Prof. Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/). You can find  more details about me in my {{% staticref "pdf/cv.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}.
